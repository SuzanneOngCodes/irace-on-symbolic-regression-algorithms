## Scenario setup for Iterated Race (iRace).
############################################################################

## To use the default value of a parameter of iRace, simply do not set
## the parameter (comment it out in this file, and do not give any
## value on the command line).

## File that contains the description of the parameters.
parameterFile = "./parameters.txt"

## Directory where the programs will be run.
execDir = "."

## File to save tuning results as an R dataset, either absolute path
## or relative to execDir.
logFile = "./irace.Rdata"

## Directory where tuning instances are located, either absolute path or
## relative to current directory.
trainInstancesDir = "./"

## File that contains a list of training instances and optionally
## additional parameters for them. If trainInstancesDir is provided, irace
## will search for the files in this folder.
trainInstancesFile = "../instances.txt"

seed = 1000

## Script called for each configuration that executes the target algorithm
## to be tuned. See templates.
targetRunner = "./target-runner"

## Optional script or R function that provides a numeric value for each
## configuration. See templates/target-evaluator.tmpl
# targetEvaluator = "./target-evaluator"

## The maximum number of runs (invocations of targetRunner) that will
## performed. It determines the (maximum) budget of experiments for the tuning.
maxExperiments = 1000

## Indicates the number of decimal places to be considered for the
## real parameters.
digits = 2

## Number of calls to targetRunner to execute in parallel. Less than 2
## means calls to targetRunner are sequentially executed.
parallel = 4
budget = 10000000

## Statistical test used for elimination. Default test is always F-test
## unless capping is enabled, in which case the default test is t-test.
## Valid values are: F-test (Friedman test), t-test (pairwise t-tests with
## no correction), t-test-bonferroni (t-test with Bonferroni's correction
## for multiple comparisons), t-test-holm (t-test with Holm's correction
## for multiple comparisons).
testType = "F-test"

## Number of instances evaluated before the first elimination test. It
## must be a multiple of eachTest.
firstTest = 10

## Number of instances evaluated between elimination tests.
eachTest = 1

## Enable/disable load-balancing when executing experiments in parallel.
## Load-balancing makes better use of computing resources, but increases
## communication overhead. If this overhead is large, disabling
## load-balancing may be faster.
loadBalancing = 0

## File containing a list of logical expressions that cannot be true
## for any evaluated configuration. If empty or NULL, do not use a file.
forbiddenFile = "./forbidden.txt"

testInstancesFile = "../instances.txt"

testNbElites = 1
testIterationElites = 1

## Enable/disable elitist irace.
elitist = 1

## Number of instances to add to execution list before previous instances in
## elitist irace.
elitistNewInstances  = 1

## Limit for the elitist race, number of statistical test performed without 
## elimination of configurations.
elitistLimit  = 2

## File that contains a table of initial configurations. If empty or NULL,
## all initial configurations are randomly generated.
#configurationsFile = "configurations.txt"

## User-defined R function that takes a configuration generated by irace and
## repairs it.
# repairConfiguration = ""
